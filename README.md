# MHE
Example implementation of a moving horizon estimation using Casadi and Python.
The MHE is demonstrated using a classic mass spring damper system. The damping coefficient
b should is estimated by the MHE.
Casadi is an open source tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation, it can be 
used in C++, Matlab and Python. (https://web.casadi.org/)

A more detailed explaination of the implementation follows...
